# How to escalate a ticket to another User
As a Tier 1 Help Desk technician, you will inevitably encounter technical issues that go beyond your scope of knowledge or authority. When this happens, it’s important to recognize the limits of your role and escalate the problem to Tier 2 support or the appropriate specialist. Escalation ensures that the client’s issue is resolved efficiently and accurately, while also allowing you to focus on problems that match your current skill set. Knowing when and how to escalate is a key part of providing excellent customer service and maintaining workflow within the support team.<br>

I will show you how to escalate a ticket to another user using Peppermint. 
### Lab Walkthrough:
1. Log in or go to your dashboard.
2. Click on any ticket you have open. (If you do not have one available, create one.)

3. Before escalating to the ticket to another user. Let's us leave a comment to let the contact know that someone else will be dealing with the issue. You will simply write your comment in the textbox and click on *Comment.*

*It is good to tell the contact in advance that you are escalating the ticket to another user to prevent any confusion.*

4. On the right side of the screen, click on *Admin.*
5. Click on the *User* you want to escalate it to. In my case, it is my dad because he knows where the circuit breaker is in the house lol.
