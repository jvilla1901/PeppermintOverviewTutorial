# Peppermint Overview Tutorial
In this lab, I created a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the software Peppermint to help aspiring IT professionals and students start practicing real-world help desk scenarios. I will show you how to create a ticket, add a new user, create a new contact, comment on a ticket, and escalate a ticket to another user. In addition, I will demonstrate how I troubleshoot and resolve a ticket to give you an idea of how a help desk professional handles support issues.
