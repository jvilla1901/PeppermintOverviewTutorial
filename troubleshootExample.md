# Example of how I troubleshoot problems using the CompTIA troubleshooting methodology
Troubleshooting is an essential skill for IT professionals, as a significant portion of our work involves identifying why systems or devices aren't functioning as expected. While experience plays a major role in developing the ability to resolve computer and network issues, there is also a structured framework that helps guide the diagnostic process and leads us to effective solutions.

Although this content isn’t unique to CompTIA, it’s worth noting that nearly every CompTIA certification includes objectives focused on troubleshooting methodology. This structured process has been developed over time through real-world experience and serves as a valuable guide for newcomers in the IT field when approaching problem-solving.
### Here is the CompTIA troubleshooting methodology:
  - Identify the problem
  - Establish a theory of probable cause
  - Test the theory to determine the cause
  - Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects
  - Implement the solution or escalate as necessary
  - Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
  - Document findings, actions, outcomes and lessons learned

I click on the ticket and I read the rest of the message. 

The contact was my Mom. She has sent a ticket saying that the internet does not work despite the router being plugged in. Plus, her devices were not being connected to the internet.

So I start with the first step in the CompTIA Troubleshooting methodology which is **identify the problem.**

1. Identify the Problem
  - I ask the client questions:
    - “When did this issue start?”
    - "Did anything change recently? (for example: new device, storm, service outage)”
  - I Check connections:
